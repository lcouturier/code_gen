# Enum Steroids

**Supercharge your Dart enums with powerful code generation!**

Enum Steroids is a Dart project that leverages code generation to enhance enums. It automatically provides utility methods that simplify common enum-related tasks, reducing boilerplate and improving code clarity.

## Packages

This monorepo contains the following key packages:

*   **`annotations`**: Defines the `@steroids` annotation. You apply this annotation to your enums to enable code generation.
*   **`generators`**: Contains the `build_runner` compatible code generators. These analyze enums marked with `@steroids` and generate helpful extension methods (in `.g.dart` files) and unit tests.
*   **`example`**: Provides a sample Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `@steroids` annotation and the code generated by the `generators` package.

## Core Feature: The `@steroids` Annotation

To enable code generation for an enum, annotate it with `@steroids` from the `annotations` package and include a `part` directive for the generated file:

```dart
import 'package:annotations/annotations.dart';

part 'my_enum.g.dart'; // Convention for generated file

@steroids
enum MyEnum {
  alpha,
  beta,
  gamma,
}
```

The `@steroids` annotation supports parameters to customize generated code, such as `hasWhen`, `hasMap`, `hasMaybeWhen`, `hasMaybeMap`, and `hasChecker` (all defaulting to `true`).

## Getting Started

1.  **Add Dependencies:**
    Modify your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      annotations: <latest_version> # Replace with actual version

    dev_dependencies:
      build_runner: <latest_version>
      generators: <latest_version> # Replace with actual version
    ```
    *(It's recommended to use specific versions from pub.dev)*

2.  **Annotate Your Enums:**
    As shown above, import `package:annotations/annotations.dart`, add the `part 'your_enum_file.g.dart';` directive, and annotate your enum with `@steroids`.

3.  **Run Code Generation:**
    Use the `build_runner` to generate the necessary files:

    For Dart projects:
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
    For Flutter projects:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
    To watch for changes and regenerate automatically:
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

## License

Please refer to the `LICENSE` files within the individual `annotations` and `generators` packages for specific licensing information. The root project may not have an explicit license; consult project maintainers if needed. It is generally recommended to include a clear open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) at the project root.
